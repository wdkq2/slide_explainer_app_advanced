# Advanced Lecture Slide Summarisation Application

This folder contains an enhanced version of the lecture slide
summarisation tool. The original project grouped slides by simple
differences in text length; this advanced version uses a hybrid
approach that combines semantic, visual, and structural cues to
identify topic boundaries and detect near‑duplicate slides. It then
summarises the unique pages and writes the results to Google Docs.

## Key Improvements

* **Hybrid Segmentation:** Pages are divided into groups by analysing
  semantic change (via OpenAI embeddings), visual change (via
  perceptual hash) and title changes. This reduces misclassifications
  for image‑heavy slides or slides with similar text lengths but
  different topics.
* **Duplicate Detection:** Pages that are nearly identical in content
  (either by cosine similarity of embeddings or low perceptual hash
  distance) are marked as duplicates. Only the first occurrence is
  summarised; subsequent duplicates are noted as such.
* **Configurable Weights:** The relative importance of semantic vs.
  visual vs. title changes can be adjusted via command‑line options.
* **Target Ratio Splitting:** When splitting into two or more groups,
  a target ratio can be specified to bias where the cut should occur
  (e.g. 0.55 for a 20/18 split in a 38‑page document).

## Usage

Install dependencies (preferably in a virtual environment):

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then run the advanced summariser:

```bash
python -m slide_explainer_app_advanced.main \
  --pdf /path/to/lecture_slides.pdf \
  --openai-key YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY \
  --google-creds /path/to/google_credentials.json \
  --title "Advanced Fluid Mechanics Summary" \
  --groups 2 \
  --target-ratio 0.53 \
  --model gpt-3.5-turbo \
  --temperature 0.3 \
  --share-email your.email@example.com
```

### Important Notes

* **Poppler requirement:** The advanced algorithm tries to convert
  pages to images using ``pdf2image``. This requires the Poppler
  library to be installed on your system. If Poppler is missing,
  visual features are skipped and segmentation falls back to
  semantic and title cues only.
* **Embedding API costs:** Computing embeddings for every page
  consumes tokens. For long documents consider batching and using
  more economical models like ``text-embedding-3-small``.
* **Weights and thresholds:** You can adjust the weights for
  semantic/visual/title features and thresholds for duplicate
  detection by editing the ``advanced_split_pdf`` function in
  ``pdf_processor.py``. This may be necessary to fine‑tune the
  behaviour for different types of slides.
* **Duplicate slides:** Pages flagged as duplicates will have the
  summary of their canonical page followed by ``(중복 슬라이드)`` in
  the final document.
